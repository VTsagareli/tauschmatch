# 🏠 TauschMatch

> Find real, two-way apartment swaps in Berlin. Minimal, efficient, and AI-powered.

TauschMatch is a modern web application that helps people find apartment exchange opportunities in Berlin using intelligent AI-powered matching. Instead of sifting through hundreds of listings manually, our system analyzes your preferences and apartment details to find truly compatible swap partners.

## 🌟 Highlights

- **🤖 AI-Powered Matching**: Uses GPT to understand preferences, lifestyle, and neighborhood vibes for smarter matches
- **📊 Two-Way Compatibility**: Analyzes both what you want and what you have to find mutual interest
- **🎯 Hybrid Scoring**: Combines structured data (60%) with semantic AI analysis (40%) for balanced results
- **💾 Save Favorites**: Keep track of listings you're interested in
- **👤 Guest Mode**: Try it out without creating an account
- **📱 Responsive Design**: Works beautifully on mobile and desktop
- **🔒 Secure**: Firebase authentication and secure data handling

## ℹ️ Overview

### What It Does

TauschMatch solves a real problem for people looking to swap apartments in Berlin. Traditional apartment exchange platforms require hours of manual browsing, reading descriptions, and hoping for mutual interest. Our platform uses AI to:

1. **Understand what you want** from your natural language description (e.g., "quiet area near parks, pet-friendly, good public transport")
2. **Understand what you have** by analyzing your apartment description and structured details
3. **Match intelligently** by comparing both sides: what you want vs what they have, and what you have vs what they want
4. **Score matches** using a hybrid approach that values both hard criteria (budget, rooms, location) and soft criteria (lifestyle, atmosphere, neighborhood feel)

### How It Works

The matching algorithm operates in two phases:

**Phase 1: Structured Matching (60% of score)**
- Filters listings based on hard criteria: budget, number of rooms, square meters, location
- Compares your apartment details with their requirements
- Fast, reliable, and transparent

**Phase 2: Semantic Matching (40% of score)**
- Uses OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo to analyze descriptions
- Understands lifestyle preferences, neighborhood characteristics, and apartment atmosphere
- Finds connections that structured filters would miss
- Provides detailed match reasons explaining why each listing is a good fit

### Who Made This?

TauschMatch was built to solve a personal problem and is now available for anyone looking to find apartment swaps in Berlin. The project uses modern web technologies and AI to make apartment matching more intelligent and less time-consuming.

### 😊 Why TauschMatch?

- **No Manual Filtering**: AI does the heavy lifting of understanding preferences
- **Two-Way Analysis**: Ensures mutual compatibility, not just one-sided matches
- **Clear Match Reasons**: See exactly why each match was suggested
- **Guest-Friendly**: Try it out immediately without signing up
- **Privacy-Focused**: Your data stays secure with Firebase authentication

## 🚀 Usage

### Quick Start

1. **Sign up** or continue as a guest
2. **Enter your apartment details**: rooms, size, rent, location, and a description
3. **Describe what you're looking for**: your preferences in natural language
4. **Click "Match"** and let AI find compatible swaps
5. **Browse results** with detailed match scores and reasons
6. **Save favorites** and contact listings you're interested in

### Example

```typescript
// Your Apartment
Rooms: 3
Size: 50 sqm
Rent: €1,100
Description: "Cozy 3-room apartment in Prenzlauer Berg, ground floor, 
              balcony with garden view, pet-friendly, quiet street"

// What You're Looking For
Min Rooms: 2
Min Size: 45 sqm
Max Rent: €800
Description: "Looking for something in Friedrichshain or Kreuzberg, 
              lively area near cafes, good public transport, 
              preferably higher floor with good light"
```

The AI will:
- Extract your preferences (lively area, cafes, good transport, light)
- Match against listings that have what you want
- Verify that your apartment meets their requirements
- Provide detailed compatibility reasons for each match

### Key Features

## 🏆 Examples

### Real-World Use Case

**The Problem**: Sarah wants to swap her 3-room Prenzlauer Berg apartment for something in Friedrichshain. She's tired of scrolling through listings manually.

**The Solution**: 
1. Sarah enters her apartment details and writes: "Looking for something more lively, near cafes, good for nightlife"
2. TauschMatch's AI understands she wants a vibrant, social neighborhood
3. It matches her with listings in Friedrichshain and Kreuzberg
4. Shows detailed reasons: "You want a lively area, and they offer an apartment in Friedrichshain near Simon-Dach-Straße (cafe district)"

**The Result**: Sarah finds 3 highly compatible matches in minutes instead of hours of manual browsing.
