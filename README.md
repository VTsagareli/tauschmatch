- **🎯 Hybrid Scoring**: Combines structured data (60%) with semantic AI analysis (40%) for balanced results
- **💾 Save Favorites**: Keep track of listings you're interested in
- **👤 Guest Mode**: Try it out without creating an account
- **📱 Responsive Design**: Works beautifully on mobile and desktop
- **🔒 Secure**: Firebase authentication and secure data handling

## ℹ️ Overview

### What It Does

TauschMatch solves a real problem for people looking to swap apartments in Berlin. Traditional apartment exchange platforms require hours of manual browsing, reading descriptions, and hoping for mutual interest. Our platform uses AI to:

1. **Understand what you want** from your natural language description (e.g., "quiet area near parks, pet-friendly, good public transport")
2. **Understand what you have** by analyzing your apartment description and structured details
3. **Match intelligently** by comparing both sides: what you want vs what they have, and what you have vs what they want
4. **Score matches** using a hybrid approach that values both hard criteria (budget, rooms, location) and soft criteria (lifestyle, atmosphere, neighborhood feel)

### How It Works

The matching algorithm operates in two phases:

**Phase 1: Structured Matching (60% of score)**
- Filters listings based on hard criteria: budget, number of rooms, square meters, location
- Compares your apartment details with their requirements
- Fast, reliable, and transparent

**Phase 2: Semantic Matching (40% of score)**
- Uses OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo to analyze descriptions
- Understands lifestyle preferences, neighborhood characteristics, and apartment atmosphere
- Finds connections that structured filters would miss
- Provides detailed match reasons explaining why each listing is a good fit

### 🔍 How TauschMatch Differs from Traditional Filtering

Traditional apartment exchange websites (like tauschwohnung.com) use simple filtering: you set criteria (max rent, min rooms, district) and either get results that match or don't. TauschMatch goes beyond this with intelligent **scoring and ranking**.

#### Traditional Filtering
- **Binary pass/fail**: Listings either match your filters or are excluded
- **No ranking**: All results treated equally, usually sorted by date
- **One-way**: Only checks "what you want vs what they have"
- **No nuance**: A €750 apartment and €850 apartment (when you set max €800) are both excluded, even though €850 might be acceptable

#### TauschMatch's Structured Matching

**1. Scoring, Not Just Filtering**
After initial filtering, every listing gets a **0-10 score** based on how well it matches:
- **€600** (20% under budget) → Excellent score (35/35 points)
- **€800** (at budget) → Good score (30/35 points)
- **€880** (10% over) → Still acceptable (22/35 points) — not excluded!
- **€960** (20% over) → Lower score (12/35 points) but still shown
- **3 rooms** (when you want 2) → Bonus points for extra space (28/30 points)
- **1 room** (when you want 2) → Acceptable but lower score (18/30 points)

**2. Two-Way Matching**
Unlike traditional sites, TauschMatch checks **both directions**:
- **"What you want vs what they have"**: Traditional filtering
- **"What you have vs what they want"**: Ensures mutual compatibility for swaps
  - Example: You have a balcony → They want "outdoor space" → Perfect match!

**3. Weighted Criteria**
Uses weighted scoring (budget 35%, rooms 30%, district 20%, type 10%, size 5%), so a slightly over-budget listing in your preferred district can still rank highly.

**4. Smart District Matching**
Detects related districts (e.g., "Kreuzberg" matches "Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg") and gives partial credit instead of excluding.

**5. Ranked Results**
Shows best matches first, not just chronological order. This means the most compatible swaps appear at the top of your results.

**Result**: You see more relevant matches, ranked by actual compatibility, not just by when they were posted.

## 🚀 Usage

### Quick Start

1. **Sign up** or continue as a guest
2. **Enter your apartment details**: rooms, size, rent, location, and a description
3. **Describe what you're looking for**: your preferences in natural language
4. **Click "Match"** and let AI find compatible swaps
5. **Browse results** with detailed match scores and reasons
6. **Save favorites** and contact listings you're interested in

### Example

```typescript
// Your Apartment
Rooms: 3
Size: 50 sqm
Rent: €1,100
Description: "Cozy 3-room apartment in Prenzlauer Berg, ground floor, 
              balcony with garden view, pet-friendly, quiet street"

// What You're Looking For
Min Rooms: 2
Min Size: 45 sqm
Max Rent: €800
Description: "Looking for something in Friedrichshain or Kreuzberg, 
              lively area near cafes, good public transport, 
              preferably higher floor with good light"
```

The AI will:
- Extract your preferences (lively area, cafes, good transport, light)
- Match against listings that have what you want
- Verify that your apartment meets their requirements
- Provide detailed compatibility reasons for each match

### Key Features
